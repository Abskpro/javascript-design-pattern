## Types of Design Patterns

- [Creational](#creational)
- [Structural](#structural)
- [Behavioral](#behavioral)

### Creational

- [Simple Factory](creational/simple-factory/README.md)
- [Factory Method](creational/factory-method/README.md) Creates an instance of several derived classes
- [Abstract Factory](creational/abstract-factory/README.md) Creates an instance of several families of classes
- [Builder](creational/builder/README.md) Separates object construction from its representation
- [Prototype](creational/simple-factory/README.md) A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
- [Singleton](creational/simple-factory/README.md) A class of which only a single instance can exist

### Structural

- [Adapter](structural/adapter/README.md) Match interfaces of different classes
- [Bridge](structural/bridge/README.md) Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
- [Composite](structural/composite/README.md) A tree structure of simple and composite objects
- [Decorator](structural/decorator/README.md) Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- [Facade](structural/facade/README.md) A single class that represents an entire subsystem
- [Flyweight](structural/flyweight/README.md) A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
- [Proxy](structural/proxy/README.md) An object representing another object

### Behavioral

- [Chain of Responsibility](behavioral/chain-of-responsibility/README.md) A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
- [Command](behavioral/command/README.md) Encapsulate a command request as an object
- [Interpreter](behavioral/interpreter/README.md) A way to include language elements in a program
- [Iterator](behavioral/iterator/README.md) Sequentially access the elements of a collection
- [Mediator](behavioral/mediator/README.md) Defines simplified communication between classes
- [Memento](behavioral/memento/README.md) Capture and restore an object's internal state
- [Observer](behavioral/observer/README.md) A way of notifying change to a number of classes
- [Visitor](behavioral/visitor/README.md) Defines a new operation to a class without change
- [Strategy](behavioral/strategy/README.md) Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
- [State](behavioral/state/README.md) Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
- [Template Method](behavioral/template-method/README.md) Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
